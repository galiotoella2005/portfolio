                                 Navigating GitHub and WordPress -
                Throughout the first semester of DIGIT 100 we have explored two main website development programs,
            GitHub and WordPress. GitHub provides a powerful environment for coding and
            collaboration, with the use of one of its coding copartners, Oxygen XML Editor. One main
            drawback is it can be daunting for those unfamiliar with programming. In contrast,
            WordPress offers an accessible platform for creating websites with less technical
            knowledge required. The most noticeable difference between GitHub and WordPress is the
            complexity of use. 
                GitHub is a platform primarily for collaborative coding, and it
            requires a solid understanding of coding principles. Each task demands familiarity with
            commands and often involves navigating the command line. This can be discouraging for
            those new to coding. In contrast, WordPress, in my opinion, is designed with
            user-friendliness in mind as it allows users to build and manage websites without
            extensive coding knowledge. Tutorials and guides are readily available, making it easier
            for beginners to understand how to create and customize their sites. This is one of
            WordPress's greatest strengths, allowing users to focus more on content creation and
            design rather than technical challenges. While WordPress is easier to navigate, GitHub
            offers more tools to enhance creativity and functionality in individual websites. GitHub
            allows for greater customization and control over the website, allowing users to create
            unique websites. Both websites have their strong aspects! 
                As I reflect on my own journey, I recognize the desire to enhance both my GitHub and 
            WordPress skills. On my WordPress site, I aim to make it more creative and interactive. 
            This includes adding multimedia elements such as videos and external links to enrich the user experience.
            Similarly, I am eager to expand my capabilities on GitHub. I want to learn how to
            integrate creative elements into my projects, potentially developing interactive
            features that showcase my coding skills.
                In summary, while GitHub presents a more
            challenging environment for beginners due to its coding requirements, it offers endless
            creative potential and room for building coding skills. WordPress, with its
            user-friendly interface and extensive resources, allows for quicker learning and use.
            Both platforms require patience and commitment to master. As I continue my journey in
            web development, I am excited to enhance the creativity and interactivity of my projects
            on both GitHub and WordPress, ultimately allowing my skills to flourish in diverse and
            innovative ways!</p>
