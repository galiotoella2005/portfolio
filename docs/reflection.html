    <body>Navigating GitHub and WordPress Throughout the first semester of DIGIT 100 we have
        explored two main website development programs, GitHub and WordPress. GitHub provides a
        powerful environment for coding and collaboration, with the use of one of its coding
        copartners, Oxygen XML Editor. One main drawback is it can be daunting for those unfamiliar
        with programming. In contrast, WordPress offers an accessible platform for creating websites
        with less technical knowledge required. The most noticeable difference between GitHub and
        WordPress is the complexity of use. GitHub is a platform primarily for collaborative coding,
        and it requires a solid understanding of coding principles. Each task demands familiarity
        with commands and often involves navigating the command line. This can be discouraging for
        those new to coding. In contrast, WordPress, in my opinion, is designed with
        user-friendliness in mind as it allows users to build and manage websites without extensive
        coding knowledge. Tutorials and guides are readily available, making it easier for beginners
        to understand how to create and customize their sites. This is one of WordPress's greatest
        strengths, allowing users to focus more on content creation and design rather than technical
        challenges. While WordPress is easier to navigate, GitHub offers more tools to enhance
        creativity and functionality in individual websites. GitHub allows for greater customization
        and control over the website, allowing users to create unique websites. Both websites have
        their strong aspects! As I reflect on my own journey, I recognize the desire to enhance both
        my GitHub and WordPress skills. On my WordPress site, I aim to make it more creative and
        interactive. This includes adding multimedia elements such as videos and external links to
        enrich the user experience. Similarly, I am eager to expand my capabilities on GitHub. I
        want to learn how to integrate creative elements into my projects, potentially developing
        interactive features that showcase my coding skills. In summary, while GitHub presents a
        more challenging environment for beginners due to its coding requirements, it offers endless
        creative potential and room for building coding skills. WordPress, with its user-friendly
        interface and extensive resources, allows for quicker learning and use. Both platforms
        require patience and commitment to master. As I continue my journey in web development, I am
        excited to enhance the creativity and interactivity of my projects on both GitHub and
        WordPress, ultimately allowing my skills to flourish in diverse and innovative ways! </body>
