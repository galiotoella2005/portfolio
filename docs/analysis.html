            <p style="color:SlateBlue;"> Ronald Reagan's 1985 and Theodore Roosevelt's 1905
                inaugural addresses are representative of their respective eras and capture the
                unique issues and themes of their respective presidencies. The rhetoric, tone, and
                content of each address show variations influenced by the political environment and
                the leaders' individual styles, even though they all sought to uplift and lead the
                country. The two addresses are contrasted and compared here. </p>

            <p style="color:SlateBlue;"> Voyant comparison of the two texts </p>
        </div>
        <div class="textBoxImage">
            <p style="color:HotPink;"> The recurring subject of Reagan's speech is the idea of
                American exceptionalism. Reagan emphasized throughout his speech that America was
                the world's leading source of hope for human liberty and a beacon of freedom.
                Because of the ongoing Cold War and the rivalry with the Soviet Union, this theme
                was especially prevalent. This is demonstrated by the Voyant graph analysis, where
                his most utilized and significant terms are freedom, people, and the world. </p>
            <p style="color:SlateBlue;">Roosevelt's speech centers on the concepts of progressivism and national power.
                Roosevelt discussed the significance of ongoing reform and emphasized the necessity
                of the government shielding the general populace, especially workers, from the
                abuses of large corporations. He also underlined the need of moral strength and said
                that America's greatness relied in its capacity to overcome obstacles. This is seen
                in the Voyant analysis, where the terms "people," "life," "nation," "great," and
                "problems" appear most frequently.</p>

        <div class="textBoxImage">
            <p style="color:HotPink;">Final Comparison</p>
            <p style="color:SlateBlue;"> Although American power, unity, and exceptionalism were
                prominent themes in both addresses, their perspectives on governance, social
                responsibility, and the United States' place in the world were different. Reagan's
                speech demonstrated a conservative emphasis on limited government, individual
                liberty, and optimism about the future of the country, whereas Roosevelt's speech
                was more focused on reform and the government's active involvement in forming
                society. Both speeches, which were representative of their respective eras,
                presented a vision for the country: Reagan's looked forth at American leadership and
                global democracy, while Roosevelt's looked inward at domestic reform.</p>
